## So, let's get going?

Hi, I'm Ruan. 

I'm brazillian and a math PhD student that maybe should've studied humanities. Oh well. Since my advisor has (strongly) suggested *not* to turn my thesis into a literary adventure, this shall be my outlet.

And so, how can I start? I think, to introduce my self, a list of my favorites? 

"Favorites, what?" you ask. **My favorites**. But, since this will be primarily a literary blog, let's start with books.


<div class="book-gallery">

  <div class="book-item">
    <img src="/images/berserk_cover.png" alt="Berserk cover" />
  </div>
  <div class="book-item">
    <img src="/images/dispossed_cover.jpg" alt="The Dispossessed cover" />
  </div>
  <div class="book-item">
    <img src="/images/intermitencias_cover.jpg" alt="Intermitências cover" />
  </div>
  <div class="book-item">
    <img src="/images/LOTR_cover.jpg" alt="Lord of the Rings cover" />
  </div>
  <div class="book-item">
    <img src="/images/frankenstein_cover.jpg" alt="Frankenstein cover" />
  </div>
  <div class="book-item">
    <img src="/images/the_Idiot_cover.jpg" alt="The Idiot cover" />
  </div>
</div>
This is not a usual arrangement of books. To say that Berserk is closer to Lord Of the Rings than to any other is a wild take in a list but here we are, dancing tango with the devil. Only looking this, at the same time I think you can take a pretty accurate guess at who I am and still not be sure what my favorite genre is.

But here it is what make me like, love, adore and be obsessed with a book (an any media in general) and I think is the thread that ties these books together
